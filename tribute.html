        <ol>While you're at it, here are some fun facts about Araki-Sensei:
          <li>Araki develops the personality of his characters based on their stand ability, as stated in his book <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=araki+manga+in+theory+and+practice&oq=araki+manga+in+theory+and+practice&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOdIBCDQ3MzlqMGoxqAIAsAIA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8">"Manga in Theory and Practice".</a></li>
          <li>Araki drew inspiration from a manga named "The Fist of The North Star" (it is the origin of the "Omae wa, mou shinde iru. Nani!?" meme!)</li>
          <li>JoJo currently has more chapters than One Piece, which currently has around 1000+ episodes, while JoJo only has 190 episodes!</li>
          <li>Araki's main inspiration came from popular hollywood movies in his childhood, which pretty much explains the use of western culture and music in the JoJo manga and anime.</li>
